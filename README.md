## Overview
This is the official repository for the manuscript entitled "Forecasting Daily Reference Evapotranspiration in Different Hydrological Conditions Through Hybrid Wavelet–Bayesian Optimization–Gaussian Process Regression" providing all code and associated datasets."

## Key Components
- Wavelet Transform (W): To break down the timeseries of input data
- Bayesian optimization (BO): To optimize the hyperparameters of WGPR 
- Gaussian Process Regression (GPR): To forecast the daily reference evapotranspiration for 1-, 3-, 5-, and 7-day-ahead 

## Prerequisites
These codes are written using MATLAB programming language and the following toolboxes:
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
- Wavelet Toolbox
